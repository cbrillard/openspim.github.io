<img src="https://openspim.org/images/%C2%B5OS_Logo.png" width="200"></a> </br>Welcome! µOpenSPIM is an intuitive new graphical user interface (GUI) for OpenSPIM users, which relies on [µManager](https://micro-manager.org). You can also visit our [Github website](https://github.com/openspim/micro-OpenSPIM).

## Quick Menu
-	[Image acquisition](/micro-openspim_acquisition)</br>

## Features of µOpenSPIM
<details>
<p>

-   A complete overhaul of the GUI has been made including simple graphic visualizations and an improved control over Picard’s 4D-stage
-   A user-friendly way of setting up multiview time lapse recordings with several positions and the option to acquire periodic and sporadic intervals with optional breaks during time-lapse recordings
-   A quick save function for nearly all acquisitions settings to save time in case an imaging session is interrupted or a similar session will take place at another time
-   Different saving formats (single plane tiff files, whole stacks or n5 format)
-   ArduinoUNO support
-   On-the-fly image processing
-   new drift-correction functionality
</p>

## µOpenSPIM requirements
-   All hardware components of an OpenSPIM system (Laser, Camera, Stage, etc.) have to be pre-configured with µManager's Hardware Configuration Wizard using Version 2.0 gamma (nightly build 04 May 2021) on a Windows7/10 computer.
-   µOpenSPIM has been tested with Picard's USB 4D-Stage in mind. Using different 4D-Stages should work but could lead to unexpected behaviour.

## How to set up µManager before using µOpenSPIM?
-   Click [here](/micro-openspim_micromanager-configuration) if you have never created a working .cfg file with µManager before or/and want to get guidance on configuring multiple cameras, pixel size calibration and configuring an ArduinoUNO board for µManager.

## Installation and start-up of µOpenSPIM
µOpenSPIM is in its beta stage and works with µManager 2.0.1 20210721 for Windows (nightly build 21 July 2021).</br>
Visit our [µOpenSPIM-Github Site](https://github.com/openspim/micro-OpenSPIM) for previous releases and more information.
-	1.  Please [download](https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/~MM/builds/2.0/Mac/Micro-Manager-2.0.0.dmg) and install the [64-bit](https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/2.0/Windows/MMSetup_64bit_2.0.1_20210721.exe) build of [µManager](https://micro-manager.org/) and follow its *Hardware Configuration Wizard* to create a functional configuration file (.cfg) that allows µManager to control the OpenSPIM hardware. On the first time startup of µOpenSPIM users will be asked to select the file location of µManager.

-	2.	**Download µOpenSPIM**
	-	[Win64bit](https://github.com/openspim/micro-OpenSPIM/releases/download/v1.0.4/OpenSPIM_setup_1.0.4.exe)
	-	[MACOSX](https://github.com/openspim/micro-OpenSPIM/releases/download/v1.0.4/OpenSPIM-1.0.4.dmg)

</details>

-	3.  In the starting window multiple µManager configuration files can be added, removed and selected. Click *Add .cfg file* to add and then select your working µManager configuration file ending with .cfg. Then click the *Start* button. After loading the hardware µManager should now be ready for use.
